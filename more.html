            <h2>GCSE:</h2>
   <p>Exam boards develop and award GCSEs. The content for these qualifications is prepared and published by the government.<br><br>
Private tutoring can be invaluable at GCSE level as students are increasingly feeling the pressure to achieve top grades in order to be qualified to study their desired A- Level subjects. A number of universities now require Maths, English and Science GCSE as a pre-requisite for university admission; so, in many ways, success at GCSE is as important as it is at A-Level. It is crucial to start to prepare your child as soon as possible, allowing the child to soak up the knowledge and not feeling rushed, stressed or under pressured.<br><br>
2016 is the last year on the old system. Students will now get grades by numbers, 1 being the lowest and 9 the highest. New specification have been introduced and the challenge to attain the old Grade C has become somewhat difficult. <br><br>
Just to mention Maths as an example,<br><br> 
GCSE Mathematics is getting more demanding<br><br>
<h5>GCSE Maths is going to change and get more demanding for everyone:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The volume of subject content has increased. You may need more time to teach it.</li>
    <li>The demand of that content is increasing too, with harder topics being introduced for both  Foundation Tier and Higher Tier students.</li>
    <li>The total time for the examinations is increasing, from 3 ½ hours to 4 ½ hours. All exams will be sat at the end of the course.</li>
    <li>There are fewer marks at the lower grades and more marks at the higher grades at both Foundation Tier and Higher Tier.</li>
    <li>There are fewer marks at the lower grades and more marks at the higher grades at both Foundation Tier and Higher Tier.</li>
    <li>In the assessments there’s a greater emphasis on problem solving and mathematical reasoning, with more marks now being allocated to these higher-order skills.</li>
    <li>Students will be required to memorise formulae – fewer formulae will be provided in examinations.</li>
</ul><br>
<h5>The amount of work that is presented to GCSE students is substantial; therefore the key to success is:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>developing weakness into strengths through diagnostic testing</li>
    <li>personalised development plan for the students which maps the subject syllabus </li>
    <li>exam preparation </li>
    <li>organisation </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<p>
    At Grade Up we help students by integrating all of the above as well as focus on important revision strategies as well as providing exam materials and techniques that will help them answer GCSE exam questions clearly and concisely.<br>
GCSE grades are commonly requested by post 16 schools and colleges, further or higher education institutes such as Universities, apprenticeship providers as well as potential employers. These exams have a huge impact on the future of every child who takes GCSE exams and so it is absolutely important for students to achieve the best grades they possibly can. <br>
GCSE are not just for 15-16 year old, but students in England are entitled to study English and Maths until they reach 19 years of age without being charged for them in secondary schools, this is for those students who are under the age of 19 and  have not achieved a grade C by 2016 or grade 4 by 2017 or grade 5 by 2018. <br><br>
The number of 16 to 18 year old students studying English GCSE increased from 52,000 in 2012 to 2013 to 79,800 in 2013 to 2014. This is an increase of 53% from the 2012 to 2013 year end position.<br>
The number of 16 to18 year old students studying maths GCSE increased from 46,400 in 2012 to 2013 to 63,000 in 2013 to 2014. This is an increase of 36% from the 2012 to 2013 year end position<br><br>
<em>Patterns of study among 16- to 18-year-old,From:Department for Education, First published:31 October 2014</em><br><br>
One reason for this increase in students continuing to study GCSE English and Maths may be that the GCSE curriculum was very challenging and students needed further support as well as access to the curriculum at higher level. If a student does not achieve grade a grade C or the benchmark grade this can have a huge negative impact and can build a mental block for students to feel that they will not  do any better should they sit the exam again as well has weaken their confident, this is why it is more important to get it right the first time and even more important to have support for the 2nd attempt.<br><br>
The way in which our tuition is structured varies from student to student. Not every child that needs help is behind academically. It could be that the child needs to achieve a higher grade then the school aim grade or a child is aspiring to take up a career that they need access to further challenges in subject content or simply access to subject content.  Quite often the issues are more down to confidence rather than ability. As students taste some success and feel a sense of achievement, with our help at Grade Up students will start to display confidence and engagement in school life and in school lessons.  English and Maths are embedded across all subjects and as students develop in these subjects they also start to make progress, feel confident and engage in lesson across other subjects. Just as the programme of study is tailored to meet every child’s individual needs, so is the approach we use as a tutor. It’s also not uncommon for us to work with students that are very capable and doing very well on the whole, but just need a boost in the right places to move up to the next grade<br><br>
All our GCSE tutors hold degrees in their subject areas and the majority teach in schools.

            <h2>A level:</h2>
   <br>
   <p>Exam boards develop and award GCSEs, AS and A levels. The content for these qualifications is prepared and published by the government.<br><br>
At Grade Up we offer A level tuition for Maths, Biology ,Chemistry and Physics.
Just like the SATs and GCSE curriculum there are many changes to A level model as well. Traditionally students had several attempts to pass or improve their grade by retaking unit exams, with the new model this is not the case, one exam at the end of the study period. Therefore it is really important to give it 100% and students feel confident enough to sit the exam.
<br><br>
The fundamental change is the separation of AS and A level. In the old model, the AS qualification forms 50% of the examination and the AS papers are usually sat at the end of the first year of study, and sometimes re-sat during or at the close of the second year; the A level (or ‘A2’) papers are sat at the end of the second year. The AS level papers are pitched at a lower standard than the A2 papers – the standard that an A level student might be expected to reach after one year of their course.<br><br>
In the new model, the AS and A level qualifications are completely separate examinations. Although the AS level specifications often feature content that is also on the A level specifications, the AS
grade makes no contribution to the A level grade. You might be in  a group that features AS and A level students, but you’re on distinct courses, with the A level papers pitched at a higher standard than the AS papers. If you’re following one or more of the new A level courses, you’ll sit all of the papers for that A level in one go, usually after two years of study.<br><br>
<h5>Finally, the new A level courses are different to those they replace. In particular, they are
likely to have the following features:
</h5>
<ol>
   <li>A greater focus on extended writing.</li> 
   <li>A greater focus on spelling, punctuation and grammar (or
‘SPaG’).</li>
<li>Fewer multi-part and low mark questions.</li>
<li>A focus on written examinations rather than ‘coursework’ or
‘controlled assessments’.</li>
<li>A greater focus on ‘English’ authors and ‘British’ history.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Taken together, these changes would suggest that the new A levels  will be tougher than the old ones. in terms of UCAS points, they will be valued at 40% of the value of an A level grade. Traditionally, an AS level has been worth 50% of the value of an A level grade. And, although the standard of AS levels is not changing, we would expect the style of the new AS level papers to reflect that of the new A levels.
<br>
Successful students are independent learners but they do not simply learn alone. Instead, they draw on the expertise of others and a range of learning resources to develop their skills and knowledge. In particular, successful students engage with their teachers differently. They don’t simply depend on teacher instruction to get them through.

            <h2>Pre Entry Exams:</h2>
   <br>
   <p>Many students sit in year 6 sit a pre entry exam as part of the admission process into selective secondary schools. Respected and competitive public schools require students to take this exam and select students based on their results. <br><br>
Exam techniques and access to advance curriculum are key to ensuring students have the best chance to succeed at pre entry exams. At Grade Up we adhere to structured exam training and organisation of important material to give students the best support in their preparation.  For further advice and assistance contact Grade Up and we will be happy to help.<br><br>
At Grade Up we offer private tuition for children preparing for pre entry exam from the age of 8 years old. Our tutors work with students to help them understand key areas within the Pre Entry Exam.
